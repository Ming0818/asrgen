In this research we have investigated the use of speech generative models to
perform adversarial attacks on speaker recognition systems. We show that the
samples from autoregressive models we trained, i.e. SampleRNN and WaveNet, or
downloaded from the web were not able to fool the CNN speaker recognizers we
used in this research. On the other hand, we show that adversarial examples
generated with GAN networks are successful in performing targeted and untargeted
adversarial attacks given the speaker recognition used herein.
